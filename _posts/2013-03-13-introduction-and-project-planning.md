#### Project Management

</br>

* **Objective** :
	- Primary : Ensuring that projects are delivered within the defined resource constraints
	- Secondary: To optimise and minimise the use of available resources    

</br>

* Motivation: **Software crisis**: growth in application size and complexity, 20% useful features VS 64% mostly wasted effort, **project failure** (lack of project definition, of client involvement, poor quality control and project management)

***

#### Project Planning

</br>

* **WBS** (**Work Breakdown Structure**): Shows hierarchy of project tasks or work products. It forms the framework for a project plan specifying what tasks are needed, but not when the activities will occur. It’s essentially a structured project To-Do list.

* **PERT chart** (**Program Evaluation and Review Technique** also called **CPM** – **Critical Path Method**) or Network diagram: Project schedule, task dependency. Shows the sequence in which activities must be done (dependencies (derived from the WBS)

* **Gantt chart** or Schedule: Stage plan, task VS time. Shows scheduling of work products as a function of time. Useful for planning, scheduling and monitoring a project (derived from the WBS, sync task dependencies with the PERT chart). It can also show resource availability, staff assignment and staff loading.

* Estimating task duration:  
	- **Qualitative**: break project into task, assign task to individuals, they estimate time for their own task, apply **fudge factor** (x2)
	- **Quantitative**: Time = (Optimistic time + 4 x Most likely time + Pessimistic time) / 6

</br>

* Risk:  
	- **Risk management process**: Risk identification (list of potential risk), Risk analysis (prioritised risk list), Risk planning (risk avoidance and contingency plans), Risk monitoring (risk assessment)  
	- **Risk factors**: staff change, management change, hardware unavailability, requirements change, specification delay, size underestimate, technology change, product competition…
	- Risk Matrix: Used in risk assessment to quantify risk; Matrix of likelihood (**probability**) VS consequence (**severity**)
