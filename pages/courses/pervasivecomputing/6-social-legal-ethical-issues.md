#### UK legislation that affects pervasive systems
* EHRA (European Human Right Act) – Article 8: Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.
* PEC (Privacy and Electronic Communications) Regulations 2003: restricts location processing (if the user cannot be identified or provides a value added and is done with user consentment) + cookie legislation
* RIPA (Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act): interception and acquisition of communication data + access to encrypted data
* LBP (Lawful Business Practice): RIPA extension that allows monitoring
* Equalities Act 2010: computer resources must be accessible (workstations, servers, physical and digital resources) or be easily made accessible
* DPA (Data Protection Act): gives right of access to personal information held by any data controller

<br/>

#### Data Protection Act
* Definitions: data, data controller, data processor, data subject, personal data, processing, relevant filing system, sensitive personal data

<br/>

#### International law
* Many pervasive systems cross national boundaries – legal nightmare
* Only do what you know is allowed in all possible jurisdictions or isolate parts/data
* Don’t forget international standards

<br/>

#### Legal summary
* DPA is the main piece of legislation – we must consider it
* RIPA & LBP offer up opportunities for government and business to gather information

<br/>

#### Social Vs Ethical issues
* Most social issues have an ethical component and vice versa, some social issues may not be ethical and vice versa
* Social issues are concerned with consensus and the affects pervasive systems have on society
* Ethical issues are concerned with codification of acceptable standards of interaction

<br/>

#### Social issues
* Privacy Vs Convenience (how much do we value privacy when it impacts on convenience?)
* The digital divide part 2: after cost (part1) it is now how to use and manipulate systems
* Non-geographic relationships: a society of individuals
* Smart houses: what rights do other have to our smart home data? (e.g. smart meter)
* Law and order (also ethical)
* Healthcare (also ethical): privacy of an individual Vs increased independence

<br/>

#### Ethical issues
* Privacy
* Needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few
* Health (work/life balance, physical and mental health issues)
* Social cohesion (are we destroying or extending our social interaction with ubiquity?)
